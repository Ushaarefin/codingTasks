## store_income_task.ipynb

### Task description
In this task I cleaned the data and parsed columns. 
The objective of this task is to

- Take a look at the unique values of the 'Country' column
- Clean up the data and separate three countries

### Learning Objective
Working with **Pandas** and **Python notebooks** offers efficient data handling through powerful data structures that simplify **data cleaning**. **Python notebooks** enhance this experience by providing an interactive environment for real-time data exploration and visualization, allowing users to iteratively refine their analyses and instantly see results. Additionally, **notebooks** combine code, visualizations, and narrative text in a single document, ensuring reproducibility and easy collaboration, making them an invaluable tool for data scientists and analysts.
